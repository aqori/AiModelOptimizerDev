# AiModelOptimizerDev

## Description

A hybrid cognitive architecture combining symbolic reasoning with deep learning, leveraging graph neural networks for knowledge graph embedding and probabilistic programming for uncertainty quantification.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the AiModelOptimizerDev software project:
- "Analyzes model complexity using gradientbased attribution methods to identify optimization opportunities",
- "Optimizes model architecture using automated neural architecture search with reinforcement learning",
- "Supports multiobjective optimization for balancing accuracy, latency, and memory usage",
- "Provides automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes",
- "Includes model pruning and knowledge distillation techniques for efficient model compression",
- "Offers realtime model performance monitoring and alerting for drift detection and concept shift identification",
- "Supports explainable AI techniques such as LIME and SHAP for model interpretability and transparency"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments!
